This is a simple game I built over the course of about 7 hours spread over one week.

The basic concept of the game is that each round there is a prize.

The person who bets more "money" in a given round wins that round's prize.

If both players bet the same amount of money, the value of their bets will be contributed towards the prize of the next round.

After six rounds, the player with more earnings is declared the winner.
